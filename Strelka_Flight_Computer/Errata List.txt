E-match actuation:
- Power supply pins were connected backwards to the Op amps DONE - Circuit replaced.
- Consider replacing with more simple continuity circuit DONE

Power:
- XT-30 connector was used for power input. This should be Molex Mini-fit DONE
- OVLO should be achieved using the boost converter enable pin NOT POSSIBLE (with boost converter used)

Flash memory chip:
- Wiring to flash memory was not impedance and trace length matched DONE (50 ohm)
- Consider reorienting STM32 to 45 degrees DONE
- Consider adding a mosfet to power cycle the SD card when it does not respond.

GPS:
- Remove UART switch DONE
- Consider adding SMA connector instead of U.FL DONE

SPI:
- Breakout SPI and CS lines to better location NOT DONE (removed due to routing difficulty)
- 33R series resistors create large voltage drop when SPI lines are somewhat long. Remove these resistors.

SWI/SWD:
- Consider breaking out SWO pin DONE

SPI baro:
- Baro needs its own SPI bus because the bus cannot be used while the baro is calculating pressure DONE

Processor:
- Change to STM32H743 DONE

Gyro:
- Add high accuracy gyro DONE

Analogue:
- Add RC circuit to limit bandwidth on analogue channels DONE

RFM95W:
- Put RFM on its own SPI bus. Signal integrity issues cause the device to fail. 

Buzzer:
- Correctly connect buzzer pin to MOSFET
- Determine why buzzer fails occasionally. Likely to do with Vth of high side P-ch MOSFET

Voltage drop across diodes:
- There is a voltage drop across the diodes that feed in 5V from the ext SPI interface. It ends up being around 3.8V after passing through the 2 diodes
This results in the 5V rail being underpowered which makes the CAN IC malfunction. When the debugger is plugged in, the stm32 is powered externally and thus the voltage drop
across the diode is less because its drawing less current. Consider replacing these diodes with ideal diodes to minimise voltage drop.
