E-match actuation:
- Power supply pins were connected backwards to the Op amps DONE
- Consider replacing with more simple continuity circuit DONE

Power:
- XT-30 connector was used for power input. This should be Molex Mini-fit DONE
- OVLO should be achieved using the boost converter enable pin NOT POSSIBLE

Flash memory chip:
- Wiring to flash memory was not impedance and trace length matched
- Consider reorienting STM32 to 45 degrees DONE

GPS:
- Remove UART switch DONE
- Consider adding SMA connector instead of U.FL DONE

SPI:
- Breakout SPI and CS lines to better location

SWI/SWD:
- Consider breaking out SWO pin DONE

SPI baro:
- Baro needs its own SPI bus because the bus cannot be used while the SPI bus is active DONE

Processor:
- Change to STM32H743 DONE

Gyro:
- Add high accuracy gyro DONE

Analogue:
- Add RC circuit to limit bandwidth on analogue channels
